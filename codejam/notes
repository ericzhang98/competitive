solutions are often not long! think of obvious and short approaches, with an elegant insight
brute force for small test cases
focus on getting 2 questions correctly

dp - iterative vs recursive


round 1a
a - saw the main idea, but tried to solve the hard version of the problem...
I tried solving "find the smallest word that satisfies the constraints"
as opposed to construct a word that works, which is easily doable within constraints

b - constructing a number -> think about binary tricks


round 2
a - rekt by floating precision -> either check for off-by-one around result or binary search for it
also, whenever you need to find the (first) number within a range that satisfies a property, it's for sure bsearch
